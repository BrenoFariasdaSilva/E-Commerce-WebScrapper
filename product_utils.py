================================================================================
Author      : Breno Farias da Silva
Created     : <YYYY-MM-DD>
Description :
    <Provide a concise and complete overview of what this script does.>
    <Mention its purpose, scope, and relevance to the larger project.>

    Key features include:
        - <Feature 1 — e.g., automatic data loading and preprocessing>
        - <Feature 2 — e.g., model training and evaluation>
        - <Feature 3 — e.g., visualization or report generation>
        - <Feature 4 — e.g., logging or notification system>
        - <Feature 5 — e.g., integration with other modules or datasets>

Usage:
    1. <Explain any configuration steps before running, such as editing variables or paths.>
    2. <Describe how to execute the script — typically via Makefile or Python.>
            $ make <target>   or   $ python <script_name>.py
    3. <List what outputs are expected or where results are saved.>

Outputs:
    - <Output file or directory 1 — e.g., results.csv>
    - <Output file or directory 2 — e.g., Feature_Analysis/plots/>
    - <Output file or directory 3 — e.g., logs/output.txt>

TODOs:
    - <Add a task or improvement — e.g., implement CLI argument parsing.>
    - <Add another improvement — e.g., extend support to Parquet files.>
    - <Add optimization — e.g., parallelize evaluation loop.>
    - <Add robustness — e.g., error handling or data validation.>

Dependencies:
    - Python >= <version>
    - <Library 1 — e.g., pandas>
    - <Library 2 — e.g., numpy>
    - <Library 3 — e.g., scikit-learn>
    - <Library 4 — e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm, colorama>

Assumptions & Notes:
    - <List any key assumptions — e.g., last column is the target variable.>
    - <Mention data format — e.g., CSV files only.>
    - <Mention platform or OS-specific notes — e.g., sound disabled on Windows.>
    - <Note on output structure or reusability.>
